# Ecommerce-Book-Price-Tracker

This project is a web scraping exercise using Python and BeautifulSoup to extract book data (title, price, availability, rating, and more) from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website. The scraped data is used for further analysed using PowerBI dashboard.

## Features

* Scrapes book titles, prices, ratings, availability, and product page links
* Navigates through multiple pages of the website automatically
* Cleans and structures the scraped data into a DataFrame
* Saves the dataset to a CSV file for further use
* Suitable for use in data visualization and dashboarding

---

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* `requests` – to send HTTP requests
* `BeautifulSoup (bs4)` – for parsing HTML
* `pandas` – for storing and manipulating data
